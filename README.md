How to Use

1. Open the composition containing the precomposition
2. Select the precomp layer(s) you want to extract
3. Go to File > Scripts > Un-Precompose.jsx
4. The layers will be extracted automatically!

The script also handles complex cases like layers with separated positions (X/Y separated) and correctly applies all transformations from the precomp to the extracted layers!
